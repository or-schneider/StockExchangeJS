# Stock Exchange JS
Vanilla JavaScript implementation of a Stock Exchange search and compare  

Search for Nasdaq stocks, read about a resulted company  
or compare it with other companies :) 

Based on a Figma design by Itc  
Built for js components practice and to serve as a future reference  

#### Notes
Building components with js instead of html gives us reusability!  
At the same time I'm losing the ability to have static components  
The auto search throttling is well done. Resets with each keypress, doesn't search if the search query is the same as the last, etc  
Effective use case of promise all somewhere  
Using chart.js  
Doesn't keep in mind mobile view but does support laptop view, I think, made according to a specific design
